## Description

**`gittyx`** is an AI-powered CLI tool that analyzes a Git repository’s history and launches a local web dashboard to visualize, explore, and query the codebase’s evolution.

- CLI: Analyzes commits, diffs, and generates semantic summaries
- Web: Dashboard served locally at `http://localhost:49251` with interactive timeline and AI-powered Q&A
- **Private by design:** All data stays on the developer’s machine

## Project Goal

- Help developers quickly understand complex codebases
- Provide natural-language access to historical code decisions:
    - “When did this switch to GraphQL?”
    - “Why was Redis removed?”
- Enable safe, private AI-based understanding of repos
- Build trust: no data ever leaves the local machine

## Future Enhancements

- VSCode extension
- GitHub integration
- Team dashboards
- Timeline diff comparison (v1 → v2)

## License & OSS

- Default: Apache-2.0
- Future: Source-available + cloud license for hosted SaaS

## Vision

A trustworthy, AI-powered tool to **understand your codebase history**, built for developers who care about **clarity, security, and control**.
